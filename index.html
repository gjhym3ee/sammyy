					<p>○  In Korean, tae (태) means "to strike or break with foot"; kwon (권) means "to strike or break with fist"; and do (도) means "way," "method," or "art." Thus, taekwondo can be translated as "the way of the foot and fist" or "the way of kicking and punching."</p>
					<p>○  It has been recognized as an Olympic sport since 2000.</p>
					<p>○  Taekwodno follows a belt ranking system which is used to signify a student's level of proficiency.  In the Philippines,  the system typically starts with a white belt for beginners and progresses through various colored belts, such as yellow, blue, red, and brown, before reaching a black belt. Each belt level represents a different set of skills and knowledge that the student has acquired through practice and training.</p>

            <h4>Fighting Fear, Finding strength:<em> A Journey by CHAVEZ</em></h4>
            <p> Taekwondo introduced me to a new world of discipline and respect that I had never experienced before.  My commitment to Taekwondo grew greater as the weeks went into months and years.  I trained diligently, learning various forms, practicing kicks, and developing my techniques. With each belt I earned, I felt a sense of accomplishment that was unparalleled. Taekwondo taught me the value of setting goals and working tirelessly to achieve them. As the years passed, I became a black belt, a symbol of my dedication and hard work. Taekwondo transformed me from a timid child into a confident, disciplined, and respectful young adult. I not only excelled in the sport but also in my academics and other areas of life. Taekwondo became more than just a hobby; it became a way of life. I started teaching younger students, passing on the values and skills I had learned. The gym became a second home, and the people there were a second family. I have competed in numerous tournaments, won several medals, and traveled to different places but the real victory for me has been the personal growth that I have experienced through this sport.
Today, Taekwondo remains an integral part of my life story. I have learned to push myself beyond my limits and to never give up even when things get tough. It has shaped me into the person I am today, instilling values of discipline, respect, perseverance, and confidence. My journey with Taekwondo continues, and with each new kick, I am reminded that life is a martial art, and with the right mindset, I can overcome any obstacle that comes my way. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://templatemo.com/contact" target="_parent"></a>
